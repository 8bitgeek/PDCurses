	911221	2.0Beta	Changed back from short to int. (int is the
			correct size for the default platform.  Short
			might be too short on some platforms.  This
			is more portable.  I, also, made this mistake.)

			Many functions are now macros.  If you want
			the real thing, #undef the macro. (X/Open
			requirement.)

			Merged many sources into current release.

			Added many X/Open routines (not quite all yet).

			Added internal documentation to all routines.

			Added a HISTORY file to the environment.

			Added a CONTRIB file to the environment.

			specification.

	900114	1.4	Window origin mod in overlay() and overwrite(), on
			public (and very reasonable) request. Swapped
			#define'd values of OK and ERR; OK now 1, and
			ERR is 0/NULL. Conforms better to UNIX
			versions.  borderchars[] removed from WINDOW
			struct since the border() functions were
			redefined. Use of short wherever possible.
			Portability improvements, mispelled name of
			[w]setscrreg().

	881005	1.3	All modules lint-checked with MSC '-W3' and
			turbo'C' '-w -w-pro' switches. Support for
			border(), wborder() functions.

	881002	1.2	Rcsid[] string in all modules, for maintenance.

			Support (by #ifdef UCMASM) for uppercase-only
			assembly routine names. If UCMASM if defined,
			all assembler names are #defined as upper case.
			Not needed if you do "MASM /MX. Also missing
			declaration of cursesscroll(). Fixes thanks to
			N.D. Pentcheff
