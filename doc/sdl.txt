SDL Considerations
==================

PDCEX SDL_Surface *pdc_screen, *pdc_font, *pdc_icon, *pdc_back;
PDCEX int pdc_sheight, pdc_swidth, pdc_yoffset, pdc_xoffset;

void PDC_update_rects(void);
void PDC_retile(void);

The font can be set via the environment variable PDC_FONT. If it's not 
set, PDCurses looks for a file named "pdcfont.bmp" in the current 
directory at the time of initscr(). If neither is found, it uses the 
built-in default font, loaded from the BMP file encoded in deffont.h.

As with the font, the icon (used with SDL_WM_SetIcon() -- not used for 
the executable file) can be set via the environment variable PDC_ICON, 
and falls back to "pdcicon.bmp", and then to the built-in icon from 
deficon.h.

Interaction with stdio
----------------------

As with X11, it's a bad idea to mix curses and stdio calls. (In fact, 
that's true for PDCurses on any platform; but especially these two, 
which don't run under terminals.) Depending on how SDL is built, stdout 
and stderr may be redirected to files.
