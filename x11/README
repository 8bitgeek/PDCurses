              Welcome to PDCurses for X11 (aka XCurses)

 This is a port of PDCurses for X11.  It is designed to allow existing
 curses programs to be re-compiled with PDCurses resulting in native
 X11 programs.

 To be Done
 ----------

 - add newterm() function and have it create a new X window

 - provide a command line parsing function to enable X command line
   arguments to be parsed and stripped from the arguments passed back
   to the calling procedure.

 - add proper 'flash' behaviour
